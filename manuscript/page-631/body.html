<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Eleven o'clock to-morrow evening!"</p><p>At last, I found the staircase. But, suddenly I drew myself up on the first step, for a terrible thought had come to my mind:</p><p>"What is the time?"</p><p>Ah, what was the time? ... For, after all, eleven o'clock to-morrow evening might be now, might be this very moment! Who could tell us the time? We seemed to have been imprisoned in that hell for days and days ... for years ... since the beginning of the world. Perhaps we should be blown up then and there! Ah, a sound! A crack! "Did you hear that? ... There, in the corner ... good heavens! ... Like a sound of machinery! ... Again! ... Oh, for a light! ... Perhaps it's the machinery that is to blow everything up! ... I tell you, a cracking sound: are you deaf?"</p></div> </div>
