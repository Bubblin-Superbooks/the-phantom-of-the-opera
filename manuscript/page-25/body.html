The ghost had appeared to them in the shape of a gentleman in dress-clothes, who had suddenly stood before them in the passage, without their knowing where he came from. He seemed to have come straight through the wall.</p><p>"Pooh!" said one of them, who had more or less kept her head. "You see the ghost everywhere!"</p><p>And it was true.

As became a real ghost, he made no noise in walking.</p></div> </div>
