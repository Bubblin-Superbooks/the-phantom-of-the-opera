But, suddenly becoming alarmed again, she turned away her head.</p><p>"Higher!" was all she said. "Higher still!"</p><p>And she dragged him up toward the summit.</p><p>He had a difficulty in following her. They were soon under the very roof, in the maze of timber-work. They slipped through the buttresses, the rafters, the joists; they ran from beam to beam as they might have run from tree to tree in a forest.</p><p>And, despite the care which she took to look behind her at every moment, she failed to see a shadow which followed her like her own shadow, which stopped when she stopped, which started again when she did and which made no more noise than a well-conducted shadow should. As for Raoul, he saw nothing either; for, when he had Christine in front of him, nothing interested him that happened behind.</p></div> </div>
