Where is it?"</p><p>"In the cellars, on the Rotunda side. It's a very important department; we have twelve horses."</p><p>"Twelve horses! And what for, in Heaven's name?"</p><p>"Why, we want trained horses for the processions in the Juive, The Profeta and so on; horses 'used to the boards.' It is the grooms' business to teach them. M. Lachenel is very clever at it. He used to manage Franconi's stables."</p><p>"Very well ... but what does he want?"</p></div> </div>
