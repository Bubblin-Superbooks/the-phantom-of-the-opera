<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Oh, I shall have all the patience necessary!"</p><p>The time passed, slow, heavy, mysterious, stifling. Richard tried to laugh.</p><p>"I shall end by believing in the omnipotence of the ghost," he said. "Just now, don't you find something uncomfortable, disquieting, alarming in the atmosphere of this room?"</p><p>"You're quite right," said Moncharmin, who was really impressed.</p><p>"The ghost!" continued Richard, in a low voice, as though fearing lest he should be overheard by invisible ears. "The ghost! Suppose, all the same, it were a ghost who puts the magic envelopes on the table ... who talks in Box Five ... who killed Joseph Buquet ... who unhooked the chandelier ... and who robs us! For, after all, after all, after all, there is no one here except you and me, and, if the notes disappear and neither you nor I have anything to do with it, well, we shall have to believe in the ghost ... in the ghost."</p></div> </div>
