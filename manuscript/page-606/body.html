We had dropped from too great a height into the torture-chamber; there was no furniture to help us reach that passage; not even the branch of the iron tree, not even each other's shoulders were of any avail.</p><p>There was only one possible outlet, that opening into the Louis-Philippe room in which Erik and Christine Daae were.
