<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"'Come and cut him down!'</p><p>"By the time I had rushed down the staircase and the Jacob's ladder, the man was no longer hanging from his rope!"</p><p>So this is an event which M. Moncharmin thinks natural. A man hangs at the end of a rope; they go to cut him down; the rope has disappeared. Oh, M. Moncharmin found a very simple explanation! Listen to him:</p><p>"It was just after the ballet; and leaders and dancing-girls lost no time in taking their precautions against the evil eye."</p><p>There you are! Picture the corps de ballet scuttling down the Jacob's ladder and dividing the suicide's rope among themselves in less time than it takes to write! When, on the other hand, I think of the exact spot where the body was discovered--the third cellar underneath the stage!</p></div> </div>
