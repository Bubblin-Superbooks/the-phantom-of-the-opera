<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On the Saturday morning, on reaching their office, the joint managers found a letter from O. G. worded in these terms:</p><p>MY DEAR MANAGERS:</p><p>So it is to be war between us?</p><p>If you still care for peace, here is my ultimatum. It consists of the four following conditions:</p><p> 1. You must give me back my private box; and I wish it to be at my free disposal from henceforward.</p><p> 2. The part of Margarita shall be sung this evening by Christine Daae. Never mind about Carlotta; she will be ill.</p><p> 3. I absolutely insist upon the good and loyal services of Mme. Giry, my box-keeper, whom you will reinstate in her functions forthwith.</p></div> </div>
